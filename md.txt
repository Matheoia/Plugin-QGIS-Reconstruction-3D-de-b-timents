b) What you need to change
Make sure you have access to the different libraries used here in the Python part of your QGIS. If necessary : "pip install geopandas" in the Python Console and, if it didn't work : run it in a terminal from your QGIS file.

You also have to download the file flowchart and put it somewhere easily accessible in a terminal. Remember the path of that file and put it instead of "C:/geoDev" in the python script :

Then, in the file flowchart that we provide, take the path of the reconstruct.json file and put it instead of C:/geoDev/reconstruct.json in here :

c) Warnings
Note that if you don't have the same path for the geof.exe of Geoflow, you also have to change it (twice).
Here we use && to make both of the command prompts, so you may have to change the && if it isn't the way it works on your computer. (Brief explanation : we change the directory of the terminal so that Geoflow recognise the flowchart runner.json that have to be associated with the reconstruct.json file)
Note that in all path files, we have some / and not .
